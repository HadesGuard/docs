TAC is an EVM equivalent network that expands the TON ecosystem, enabling Solidity developers to deploy their code on a dedicated Layer 1 while still offering their dApps as TON-native applications through TON wallets.

TAC provides a solution by allowing Solidity developers to deploy their applications while keeping all user interactions and tokens fully native to TON.

### What makes TAC unique?

- **Native TON Experience:** Access EVM applications straight from your TON wallet with the familiarity and security you trust
- **Simple Integration:** Move your EVM applications to TON without rewriting code or learning new frameworks
