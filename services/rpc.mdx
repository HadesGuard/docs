TAC is a Layer 1 blockchain introducing a novel TON-Adapter enabling Ethereum dApps to access Telegram’s 950M+ users. Solidity developers can seamlessly deploy their code to offer hybrid dApps that users can access directly through their TON wallets. TAC leverages a multi-collateral security approach through stTON, tsTON, and tgBTC restaking further enabling developers to seamlessly integrate advanced DeFi functionalities into TON consumer-facing applications and bootstrap liquidity from scratch.

This functionality layer allows builders to focus on creating intuitive, consumer-centric apps for Telegram’s billion-strong user base.

### What makes TAC unique?

* **Native TON Experience:**

   Access EVM applications straight from your TON wallet with the familiarity and security you trust

* **Simple Integration:**

   Move your EVM applications to TON without rewriting code or learning new frameworks
