TAC JavaScript SDK EVM developers to build on TON without needing an in-depth understanding of TON. By specifying the following details, the SDK will generate the necessary transactions:

**For EVM:**

- The Proxy app address to interact with. (You can get in touch with us, and we can help you to get one)
- The method to call on the contract.
- Any parameters required for the contract method.

**For TVM:**

- Addresses of TVM Jettons corresponding to EVM tokens.

<Warning>
  According to the new Telegram guidelines, only tokens native to the TON
  blockchain can be used in Telegram Mini Apps starting February 1, 2025.
</Warning>

Using these inputs, the SDK builds a TON transaction payload and enables further signature processing through TON-Connect or directly via mnemonic.

The SDK will automatically calculate TON jetton addresses based on corresponding EVM tokens, but if you are building a TMA, you will need to use TON native jettons.
